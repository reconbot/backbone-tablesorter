{"name":"Backbone-tablesorter","body":"This is a very functional Backbone.js table sorter plugin that respects your views(). Its primary use case is to render complex views as table rows for models in a collection and to preserve them when sorting, adding or removing models. I imagine you'll want to do something more with it, so it's easily extendable. I made this because I wanted people to be able to sort things while not destroying their work in complex sub views.\r\n\r\nI the backbone-tablesorter promise to:\r\n  - Not destroy your views unless you destory my models\r\n  - Not care about your rendering or updating, that's between you and your model.\r\n  - Keep all your bindings\r\n  - Do the annoying sutff for you\r\n  - Love twitter bootstrap but not make you marry it\r\n  - Love mustache.js but not make you marry it either\r\n  - Require backone.js underscore.js and jquery \r\n  - (I don't know about this zepto fellow but I'll gladly support him if it does the right stuff.)\r\n\r\nI will never do:\r\n  - Re-render your models to sort\r\n  - Drink too much coffeescript\r\n  - Care what you do in the sanctity of your own tr\r\n\r\nI only ask that you the model:\r\n  - Keep yourself a tr, I don't care about anything else\r\n  - Emit events when you'd like me to swap you out\r\n  - Only join a collection who's either a SortableList or knows one personally. (If you do a good impression that will fly too.)\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A backbone.JS powered table generation and sorter library that respects your Views();","google":"UA-8517491-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
