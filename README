This is a very functional Backbone.js table sorter plugin that respects your views().

I the backbone-tablesorter promise to:
  - Not destroy your views unless you destory my models
  - Keep all your bindings
  - Do the annoying sutff for you
  - Love twitter bootstrap but not make you marry it too
  - Love mustache.js but not make you marry it either
  - Require backone.js underscore.js and jquery (I don't know about this zepto fellow but I'll gladly support it if it does the right stuff.)
